Here's an example of how OpenTransclude pulls in content from another page on this blog.

<!-- NOTE: Add a spacing attribute with a number to override your default spacing unit for highlights (useful if you're using different text sizes or alternative styling on a post) -->
{% include portal.html title="Welcome to Jekyll!" link="/Open-Transclude/jekyll/update/2020/01/31/welcome-to-jekyll.html#lorem-ipsum" anchor="jekyll-docs" %}

<!-- NOTE: Remove '/Open-Transclude' from this to get it working locally. -->
